Data Structures
Data structure is a way of organizing data in the computer so that it can be used effectively. The data structures used in this project are:
-:) Array
-:) HashMap/Dictionary
-:) Heap
-:) Stack
-:) Graph
-:) An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. 

-:) Hashmap/Dictionary data structure is used to store key-value pairs.

-:) A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.

-:) Heaps in Python are complete binary trees in which each node is either smaller than equal to or greater than equal to all its children (smaller or greater depending on whether it is a max-heap or a min-heap).Hence the root node of a heap is either the smallest or the greatest element. The heap data structure is generally used to represent a priority queue.

-:) Graph is a complex data structure containing vertices and edges connecting these vertices.This is implemented in the project with the help of Array and HashMap/Dictionary.
